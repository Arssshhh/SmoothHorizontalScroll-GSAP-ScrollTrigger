# SmoothHorizontalScroll-GSAP-ScrollTrigger

This project is a simple **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** website that mimics the design of the [WeThinkElastic](https://wethinkelastic.com) website. The site incorporates **GSAP ScrollTrigger** animations to create interactive scrolling effects.

## Features

- **GSAP Scroll Animations**: The website leverages the **GSAP ScrollTrigger** library to create scrolling-based animations. 
  - The text "Animate" on the second page smoothly slides horizontally as you scroll.

## Project Structure

```bash
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css          # CSS for layout and design
├── script.js           # JavaScript for GSAP Scroll animations
└── assets              # Images and other static files (if applicable)
```

### Folder Details
